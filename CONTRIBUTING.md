# How contribute

Users are welcome to contribute either through new feature development, general updates, or bug fixes. Larger refactors should first be discussed with project leads.

## Generality
* You can use the IDE of your choice
* You must create a feature branch before merge
* You have to be in the mindset of the software craftsmanship
* Features must be developed with runtime speed in mind
* You must apply OOP principles
* You must apply [DRY principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) as much as possible
* You must follow the formatting laid out in .clang-format and must otherwise maintain neat, legible code
* Each development must be tested at least at the level of unit tests
* At this stage, code coverage should never go down.
 
## Documentation
* All new classes, functions, and header files must be documented.
* Documentation goes in header files and follows standard doxygen formatting
